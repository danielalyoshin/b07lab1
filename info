Modify Polynomial.java as follows:

i.    Replace the array representing the coefficients by two arrays: one representing the non-
      zero coefficients (of type double) and another one representing the corresponding
      exponents (of type int). For example, the polynomial 6 − 2𝑥 + 5𝑥³ would be represented
      using the arrays [6, -2, 5] and [0, 1, 3]
ii.   Update the existing methods accordingly
iii.  Add a method named multiply that takes one argument of type Polynomial and returns
      the polynomial resulting from multiplying the calling object and the argument. The
      resulting polynomial should not contain redundant exponents.
iv.   Add a constructor that takes one argument of type File and initializes the polynomial
      based on the contents of the file. You can assume that the file contains one line with no
      whitespaces representing a valid polynomial. For example: the line 5-3x2+7x8
      corresponds to the polynomial 5 − 3𝑥² + 7𝑥⁸
      Hint: you might want to use the following methods: split of the String class, parseInt of
      the Integer class, and parseDouble of the Double class
v.    Add a method named saveToFile that takes one argument of type String representing a
      file name and saves the polynomial in textual format in the corresponding file (similar to
      the format used in part iv)
vi.   You can add any supplementary methods you might find useful
